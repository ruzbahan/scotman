# SCoTMan: Smart Contract for Trust Management in IoT using Hyperledger Fabric

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and experimentation code for the **SCoTMan** (**S**mart **Co**ntract for **T**rust **Man**agement) method for trust management in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. The project utilizes Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain platform, and Caliper, a blockchain benchmarking tool, to conduct comprehensive tests and evaluations.

## Introduction

SCoTMan is a novel trust management approach designed to enhance security and reliability in IoT systems. It leverages Hyperledger Fabric's blockchain capabilities to provide a decentralized and tamper-resistant environment for managing trust relationships. Caliper is used for benchmarking and evaluating the performance of SCoTMan under various scenarios.
